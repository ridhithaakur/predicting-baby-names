# predicting-baby-names
Python program that utilizes historical name popularity to perform two types of analyses. 
The program would first ask the user which mode they would like to use (name comparison or maximum popularity). If the user chooses name comparison, 
then the user should be asked for two names to compare. 
The program computes the totals for each name (sum) between 1900 and 2014. 
This program should report totals for each name as well as which name was most common. If the user chooses the maximum popularity 
option, then the program should ask the user for a single name. The program reports the year between 1900 and 2014 in which that name was most popular. If the user chooses an invalid analysis, the program should alert them but allow them to perform another analysis.
